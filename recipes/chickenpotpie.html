        <li>2 (9 inch) unbaked pie crusts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.).</li>
        <li>Combine chicken, carrots, peas, and celery in a saucepan; add water to cover and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Boil for 15 minutes, then remove from the heat and drain.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over medium heat. </li>
        <li>Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed. Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place chicken and vegetables in the bottom pie crust.</li>
        <li>Pour hot liquid mixture over top. Cover with top crust, seal the edges, and cut away any excess dough.</li>
        <li>Make several small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
